# I'd like this

*Add an "I'd like this" button anywhere in a WordPress post and get user feedback on your ideas, proposals and plans.*

This is a work in progress tied to a series of posts on [theaveragedev.com](http://wp.me/p3cIyM-Fn) and as such might:

1. be successfully concluded and become another plugin lost WordPress repository 
2. be dropped along the way because it proves immensely unuseful
